# The Data
The data is the measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years

Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. However, we are only interested in Global_active_power variable.

We are implementing LSTM Network using Keras to predict the power cosumption, and doing it with MAE 0.09

The model building process takes 3 steps:

  1. Feature transformation
  2. Desriptive analysis
  3. Model Bulding
